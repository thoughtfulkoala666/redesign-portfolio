                    This site is actually complex in that it serves four main purposes targeting audiences with different needs and experiences. Users of the site use the site for:

                      <p class="p-2 px-6">The main navigation bar contains options of different types, some being dropdowns revealed on hover, and others being plain text. There is no visual indication that an option contains more information, obscuring important navigational features. 
                        Additionally, for some dropdown options, the navigation is unintuitive (some items seem to be in the wrong section).</p>

                      <p class="p-2 px-6">One of the core functions of the site is to allow users to book/reserve a dive, but there is no obvious place to do that on that nav bar. Users have to know beforehand that the calendar is interactable and is the only way to reserve a dive. All other "Call to Action"s are obfuscated (more on that later...)</p>

                      <p>All "Call to Action" buttons are overlayed on images, and it is very unclear that the text is actually a button to be used for navigation. Additionally, there is no clear distinction between the buttons used for different tasks on the site (gear-shop, book dive, reserve course, utility link)</p>

                      <p>Some navigational buttons are implemented as text, entirely inconsistent with the existing standard of using buttons for "Call to Action" purposes.

                      <p>There are at least 6 different fonts used on the front page which are not only visually unappealing, but further confuse text categorization and hierarchy.</p>

                      <p>All of the above problems, combined with general layout decisions make it very difficult for any users in one of the four audiences to figure out which parts of the site they should be using and how. There are also organizational problems within sections targeted toward user-groups, for example: divers are not offered any clues as how to find courses that match their skill level (very advanced courses listed next to very basic courses).</p>

                <h4 class="text-2xl w-3/4 font-bold text-center">In addition to identifying usability problems manually, the website was also run through the WebAIM WAVE tool to assess potential accessibility problems:</h4>
                <img src="./webaim.png" class="w-2/6">
                <p class="w-3/4 text-xl text-center">All low-contrast errors that were reported were examined and determined to be a case of poor CSS styling- as the background was detected as "white" where practically the background is a much darker and high-contrast color.
                  The alerts primarily concerned the tag-type of the navigation bar, as they are implemented as headers and not as less significant elements/buttons. This is a case of poor HTML semantics, and while it isn't ideal and slightly inhibits accessibility, the overall accessibility of the site is not greatly impacted.
                  In summary, the current accessibility of the site from an aria/wave-based standpoint is very good, with only a few minor issues that are easily fixable. The main issues lie within the greater usability of the site.</p>
